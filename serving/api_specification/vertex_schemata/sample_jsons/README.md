This folder contains both valid and invalid sample jsons based on
[instance.yaml](../instance.yaml) and [prediction.yaml](../prediction.yaml).
These files can used by the
[schema validation test](http://google3/health/imaging/externalization/common/internal_operations/schema_validation)
to assert the schema we would like Vertex to assert for the endpoint.

```
blaze test health/imaging/externalization/common/internal_operations/schema_validation:schema_test
```

**Context:** The YAML files are expressed in
[OpenAPI spec](https://swagger.io/specification/). They define the schema for
the API which is hosted as a Vertex endpoint. Read more at
https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/PredictSchemata.

**Fun fact:** The permutation of valid and invalid cases were initially
generated by Gemini.
